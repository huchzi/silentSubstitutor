\title{Emission Spectra of LEDs (Example Dataset)}
\format{
A data frame with 196 rows and 5 columns:
\describe{
\item{wavelength_nm}{Numeric. Wavelength in nanometers (nm), from 390 to 780 in 2-nm steps.}
\item{red}{Numeric. Emission spectrum of the red LED (normalized intensity).}
\item{green}{Numeric. Emission spectrum of the green LED (normalized intensity).}
\item{blue}{Numeric. Emission spectrum of the blue LED (normalized intensity).}
\item{cyan}{Numeric. Emission spectrum of the cyan LED (normalized intensity).}
}
}
\source{
Own measurements or example values for demonstration purposes.
}
\usage{
data(led_spectra)
}
\description{
This dataset contains emission spectra of four different LEDs (red, green, blue, cyan)
measured across the wavelength range from 390 nm to 780 nm in 2-nm increments.
The values represent the normalized spectral radiant power for each LED at the respective wavelengths.
}
\details{
The spectral intensities for each LED are normalized so that the values reflect the relative distribution of radiant power
across the visible spectrum. Small negative values may occur due to measurement noise or background correction and are typically negligible.
